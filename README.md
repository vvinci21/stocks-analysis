# Stocks Analysis

## OVERVIEW: VBA Stock Analysis Challenge

### Purpose
In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then determine whether refactoring code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

### Analysis and Challenges
The purpose of this challenge is too:

- Prepare our dataset `VBA_Challenge.vbs` file for the project.
- Create our resources folder in **GitHub** to hold the run-time pop-up messages that we’ll screenshot after running refactored analyses for 2017 and 2018.
- Create and convert our `XLSM` file from `*.vbs` dataset that you used in this module as `VBA_Challenge.xlsm`.
- Add the VBA_Challenge.vbs script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.
- Use the steps **Refactor VBA code and measure performance** to add code where indicated by the numbered comments in the starter code file.

#### Our Challenge Data Background
> Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

> In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

> Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.

## RESULTS: Refactor VBA Code and Measure Performance
