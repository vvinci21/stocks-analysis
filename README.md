# Stocks Analysis

## OVERVIEW: VBA Stock Analysis Challenge

### Purpose
In this challenge, we will edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then determine whether refactoring code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. 

### Analysis and Challenges
The purpose of this challenge is too:

- Prepare our dataset `VBA_Challenge.vbs` file for the project.
- Create our resources folder in **GitHub** to hold the run-time pop-up messages that we’ll screenshot after running refactored analyses for 2017 and 2018.
- Create and convert our `XLSM` file from `*.vbs` dataset that you used in this module as `VBA_Challenge.xlsm`.
- Add the VBA_Challenge.vbs script to the Microsoft Visual Basic editor.
- Use the steps **Refactor VBA code and measure performance** to add code where indicated by the numbered comments in the starter code file.

> Use your knowledge of VBA and the starter code provided in this Project to refactor the VBA Script dataset so we loop through the data one time and collect all of the information.
